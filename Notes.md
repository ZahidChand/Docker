# Application Architecture

When we work on any application, there are 3 main things:

1) **Frontend**: Angular/ReactJS/Vue.js, etc.
2) **Backend**: Java/.NET/Python/PHP
3) **Database**: Oracle, MySQL DB, SQL Server

# Application Tech Stack

Suppose we are using the following for the project:

- **Frontend**: ReactJS 18.2.0v
- **Backend**: Java 17v
- **Database**: MySQL 8.5v
- **Tomcat**: 9.0v

# Environment Setup To Run Our Application

When we work in an organization, there will be different teams: Development Team, DevOps Team, etc. Now, if the DevOps team needs to deploy the application, they need to set up the environment.

So, to set up and run our application, they will require to do the following steps:

1) Take one machine (Physical / Virtual)
2) Install ReactJS 18.2.0v
3) Install Java 17v
4) Install Tomcat Server 9.0v
5) Install MySQL DB Server 8.5v

So, DevOps need to perform these steps to set up the environment. But in real-time, there will be multiple environments.

# Application Environment

1) **Dev**: Developers will use this environment for development purposes.
2) **QA**: The testing team will use this environment for testing the application.
3) **UAT**: Clients or client-side users will use this environment for testing the application.
4) **PILOT**: This is also called the Pre-Production Environment.
5) **PROD**: Live Environment (End users will use this environment).
